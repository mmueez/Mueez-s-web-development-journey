"We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)
Not a word about Bruno!
I never should've brought up Bruno!"
