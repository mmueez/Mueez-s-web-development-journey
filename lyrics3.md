They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I never took a straight path nowhere
Life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I lived I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie I grew up in hell
A block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options
Get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap
Learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time
Go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow
My James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eye and tell her, baby I love it
You're my inspiration
You're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving with no hesitation
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I gotta hustle through the hustle
And bust while make a move
Manuever around the rats, wolves
I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block
'Cause niggas watchin' spots
I'm tryna stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip stuff 'em in clip 'case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose watch me win against the odds
All I got it my word, balls and my instinct
I'm tryna make it
We already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing missions
Big risk, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make itdrakes
